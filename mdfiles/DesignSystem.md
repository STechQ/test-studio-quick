# Plateau Design System 



PDS is a design system developed by Softtech Design Atelier to help teams create Plateau projects faster. PDS creates a bridge between the design and production phases. 

Before starting screen designs with Quick Editor, CSS code needs to be developed for a unique project.

## Page Layout

We made an improvement in the Grid Flex structure as follows. 
In this way, we have the chance to make different designs on devices with different resolutions.
Device and resolution details can be found in <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/breakpoints/#display-breakpoints" target="_blank">Vuetify breakpoints page.</a>
With this improvement, we added a few new features such as spacing, typography, text color and font emphasis.

If you want to see the same view on all devices, when you click on the "Mobile" option, the following option will appear. In this section you can see which devices for this changes.

If you want different views for different resolutions, when you select "Mobile" and "Laptop" options, two different buttons will appear.
In this way, you can design a different view for "Mobile, Tablet" resolution and a different view for "Laptop and above" resolutions.
